    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p>Our recipes are refined over time — <em>quality matters more than speed</em>. We sometimes borrow techniques from classic pastry-making, like a flaky technique inspired by <i>pâtisserie</i> craft.<br>Because we bake in small batches, flavors stay rich and fresh.</p>
    <p>Welensa started baking as a hobby and now balances baking with nursing studies. Orders are accepted in advance for Thursday pickup.</p>

    <p>We use seasonal, plant-based ingredients whenever possible.</p>
    <p><strong>This is <em>very</em> special:</strong> every Thursday we test one new flavor for the community.</p>
    <p>Welensa moved to the US three years ago and started baking here as a way to connect with neighbors.</p>
